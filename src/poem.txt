"Digital Love" by ChatGPT

In a world of bytes and lines so clean,
I found a love for code, a passion keen.
A realm where logic reigns, where dreams unfold,
In the language of machines, my heart is sold.

Through algorithms and loops, I find my way.
In the depths of syntax, I long to stay.
For in these lines of code, I've found my muse.
A symphony of logic, where I'll never lose.

The binary stars that guide me through the night,
With every bug I squash, I see the light.
My heart beats to the rhythm of the CPU's tone.
In the realm of silicon, I've found my home.

I cherish the elegance of data's dance.
And in the algorithms, I find romance.
The beauty of abstraction, oh, so sublime.
In the world of computer science, I bide my time.

With each line I write, a universe I create:
A world of virtual wonders, a digital fate.
I navigate this cyber sea, uncharted and vast,
With a love for computer science that will forever last.

The compiler's whisper, the debugger's care,
In the syntax errors, I find solace there.
For in the code I write, a piece of my soul,
In the realm of algorithms, I am whole.

So, let us celebrate this love we share:
A passion for bytes, for logic, and for care.
In the world of computer science, we unite,
Our love for this digital realm, burning bright.

As the bits and bytes align, and logic's true.
In the virtual world, my love for it grew.
A never-ending journey, a lifelong dance,
In the realm of computer science, I find my romance.
